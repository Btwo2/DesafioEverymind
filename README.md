# Everymind Challenge

##  Node.js CRUD + MongoDB Native Driver

Solving the challenge proposed by EveryMind for the fictional client Nunes Sports, a system was implemented for displaying, creating, editing, and deleting products sold by the company.

Using the NoSQL MongoDB database and the Express.js framework, it is possible to create web applications and APIs very quickly and easily. Therefore, considering the short timeframe for developing the CRUD system, I chose to use them as tools in this solution.
